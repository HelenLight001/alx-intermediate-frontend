# ALX Listing App

## About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern **Airbnb clone**. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**.

By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, this project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Objective

The objective of this milestone is to scaffold the Airbnb clone project by:

- Creating a basic **Next.js** app
- Integrating **TypeScript**
- Setting up **TailwindCSS** and **ESLint**
- Establishing a clean folder structure
- Laying the foundation for reusable components, interfaces, constants, and assets

By completing this milestone, you'll have a well-structured, maintainable codebase ready for building out the property listing page and future features.

## Project Structure Overview

Below is a brief explanation of the key directories and files within the project:

components/common/Card.tsx: This file will define a reusable Card component that will be used across the project to display information about various properties.

components/common/Button.tsx: This file will define a reusable Button component, which will be used for actions like “Book Now,” “Details,” etc.

interfaces/index.ts: Define all TypeScript interfaces related to the project. Start by creating placeholder interfaces for CardProps and ButtonProps.

constants/index.ts: Sets up constants to store any reusable data or strings such as API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text.
